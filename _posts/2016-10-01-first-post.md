This is my first blog post written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntaxq)
(more precisely, [kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html)) and
rendered into HTML using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) on
[Github](http://www.github.com).

My impression so far is that these technologies allow for development of
sophisticated websites with surprisingly little hassle!
